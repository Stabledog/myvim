# vimsane-cfg

This repo is used to provide the vim configuration for Vimsane.  The Vimsane install script forks this per user, and creates an 'upstream' git remote which points back to the original.   So the user has their own repo and bbgithub host fork, and the Vimsane maintenance scripts pull from 'upstream' to keep the user up-to-date.
