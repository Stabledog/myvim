@ Flatland

The idea of Flatland originated with a book by Edwin Abbot Abbot.   (Seriously, that is not a typographical error:  is middle and last names are the same.  He may well be an ancestor of Sirhan B. Sirhan and Duran Duran, we just don't know.  Given his contribution to modern culture, it seems to me we ought to call him Edwin Abbot Squared).
